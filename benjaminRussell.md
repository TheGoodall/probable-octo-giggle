*Interest of content:
    good - some pages contain lots of informative information, others are severely lacking (smart homes).
*Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
    Excellent - apart from the lone navbar everything is presented consistantly on a beauiful celadon green colour.
*Quality of written presentation:
    Weak - Pages are littered with gramatical and spelling errors especially the page about Google Deepmind (champion isnt spelled champien)
*Validity of HTML:
    Good - Bad characters can be found in most of the src links for image files. As well as a stray </div> tag on the Smart Homes page
*Evidence of collaboration:
    Acceptable - Some members made far more commits than others (Kevin only 3 commits smh). All author pages were written by different people. However some author pages werent written at all.
    The final commit was made just minutes before the peer review began so very very last minute.
