        <h2>What is DeepMind?</h2>
        <p>The company's goal is to "solve intelligence", by combining techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms. They are trying to formalize intelligence not only to implement it into machines, but also to understand the human brain. The company has created a neural network that is able to learn to play videogames much like a human would. Unlike other AIs, DeepMind is general purpose and can be applied to unfamiliar scenarios. Most others, such as Deep Bue or Watson from IBM, are pre-programmed specific for its purpose.</p>

        <h2>Achievements </h2>
        <p>In 2015 DeepMind developed a program called AlphaGo that beat the European Go champien Fan Hui five to zero. This marked the first time a machine bested a professional Go player. It then went on to beat Lee Sedol, ranked 9th in the world, four to one in 2016 and Ke Jie in 2017 who had held the world number one rank for two years. Later that year AlphaGo Zero was developed which defeated the original 100 to 0. It self taught and beat AlphaGo within 3 days with less processing power.

        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>As AI becomes more prevalent, the ethics behind what we should be using it for has been a hot topic. Issues such as who should be prioritised in a car crash for self driving cars has prompted DeepMind to expand its focus to include AI ethics.Their goal is to fund external research of the following themes: privacy transparency and fairness; economic impacts; governance and accountability; managing AI risk; AI morality and values; and how AI can address the world's challenges. As a result, the team hopes to further understand the ethical implications of AI and aid society to seeing AI can be beneficial</p>
